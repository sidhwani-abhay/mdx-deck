# LET'S TAKE AN EXAMPLE!
## SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A FLIGHT AND YOU HAVE TO RUSH TO THE AIRPORT. WHAT DO YOU DO? 

---
# WHAT DO WE OFFER?
## OUR WEBAPP, 'ROUTE BUFFET' GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO PLAN YOUR JOURNEY IN THE MOST OPTIMAL WAY USING THE COMBINATION OF CAB AND METRO.

---
# OUR PROCESS
## We use the APIs of Google Maps,Uber and the information and routes of the subway(metro) stations to find out the best possible combination in terms of time,money and safety for the consumer.

--- 
# HOW ARE WE DIFFERENT?
## Presently there is no way for the consumer to know about his most optimal route(time,cost and safety) using the combination of both , public transport(Metro) and private transport(Cabs).
---
# VISION FOR THE FUTURE
## We plan to add a feature using which the consumer can know about the time it will take for him to get to his destination depending on his budget.

# THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION! MAY YOU HAVE AN OPTIMAL JOURNEY !!
