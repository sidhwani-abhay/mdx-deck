# LET'S TAKE AN EXAMPLE !
### LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A CODING CLASS AT CODING BLOCKS IN KOHAT ENCLAVE AND YOU ARE GETTING LATE. WHAT ROUTE ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE? IN ORDER TO ATTEND THE CLASS YOU MUST OPTIMIZE YOUR ROUTE.THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN. YOUR GENERAL OPTIONS ARE TRAVELLING BY METRO OR TRAVELLING BY CAB. BUT THAT IS NOT THE FASTEST WAY TO REACH CODING BLOCKS. THE MOST OPTIMAL ROUTE(TIME) IS TO TAKE THE METRO TO JANAKPURI WEST AND THEN TAKE THE CAB TO KOHAT ENCLAVE. 

--- 

# LET'S TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE!
### SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A FLIGHT AND YOU HAVE TO RUSH TO THE AIRPORT. AS YOU'RE TRAVELLING , YOU HAVE TO TAKE OUT SOME MONEY FROM THE ATM. NOW THERE'S A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN WHETHER YOU SHOULD TAKE THE SAFEST ROUTE OR THE FASTEST ROUTE. WHAT DO YOU DO? 

---
# WHAT DO WE OFFER?
### OUR WEBAPP, 'ROUTE BUFFET' GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO PLAN YOUR JOURNEY IN THE MOST OPTIMAL WAY USING THE COMBINATION OF CAB AND METRO.  BEFORE HEADING OUT YOU CAN USE OUR APP TO KNOW WHICH MODE OF TRANSPORT(S) YOU MUST TAKE IN ORDER TO REACH YOUR DESTINATION IN LEAST TIME AT  THE LOWEST POSSIBLE COST AND TAKE THE SAFEST ROUTE TO REACH THERE.
---
# OUR PROCESS
### We use the APIs of Google Maps,Uber and the information and routes of the subway(metro) stations to find out the best possible combination in terms of time,money and safety for the consumer. Our add on feature is if the person is about to travel in the metro and let's suppose the metro breaks down.  He will get notified in real-time about the breakdown.

--- 
# HOW ARE WE DIFFERENT?
### Presently there is no way for the consumer to know about his most optimal route(time,cost and safety) using the combination of both , public transport(Metro) and private transport(Cabs).
---
# VISION FOR THE FUTURE
### We are planning to work on multiple transitions between the source and destination. 
### Also we plan to add a feature using which the consumer can know about the time it will take for him to get to his destination depending on his budget.
